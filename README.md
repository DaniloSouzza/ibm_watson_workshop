##  Python for AI & Development Project

A course made at [EDX](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:IBM+PY0222EN+1T2021 "EDX"). 

It is a simple course but could be very interesting to start a quick intro regarding the IBM WATSON products. Of course a good approach to new Python programmers once It shows as introduction to unit tests using the build in library `unittest` and a little bit of project architecture,

There's no such introduction to virtual environments like `pyenv`, `venv`and so on, so I decided to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

It was a very cool course to do :)
